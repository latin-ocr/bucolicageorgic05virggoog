xviii VIRGIL

explain so glaring an inconsistency. The point is
inexplicable, but we ought in fairness to remember
that the chilling shadow of imperial patronage tested y
upon Virgil. He was not only a poet but a poet·

laurente. 1t is the poet who pens the speeches of
Dido, while the poet-laureare describes the ‘good
Aeneas' to gratifya prince who in order to found an
empire-dtem conderet urbem-would certainly not have
let a woman's ruin stand in the way of state policy or
his own ambition. '

Although‚ however, as an epic poem the Aeneid is
wanting in vitality and human interest, the praise of
eighteen centuries is sufficient evidence of its striking
merits. What those merita are has been already partly

indicated in referring to the Georgica. Virgil is a 1

master of melodious rhythmy and he is a master of

 

literary expression. The Latin hexameter, which in

Ennius, the father of Latin poetry, is cumbrous and
uncouth·, and in Lucretius, though powerful and impos·
ing, still lacks grace and versatility, has been moulded
by Virgil into a perfect instrument capable of infinite
varieties and responsive to every phase of emotion3
while as regards his literary power it is impossible to
read ten lines anywhere without coming across one of
those felicitous phrases the charm of which is beyond
question as it is beyond analysis. But these external
graces are not all. Virgil is a man of deep though

controlled feeling. He is a patriot who loves his ,

country with alove ‘far brought from out the storied
past,' and his pride in her imperial greatness animates
the whole poem and lives in many a majestis line'.1
