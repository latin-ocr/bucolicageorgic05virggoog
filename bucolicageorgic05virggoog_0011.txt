training which has left such a profound impress on the
literature of the succeeding century.

On completing his education he seems to have
returned home, and some of the minor poenis ascribed
to him-Ciris, Copa, Culex, Dirae, Moratum-may be
in reality youthful attempts of his composed during
this period. Our first certain knowledge, however, of
his poetic career begins in nc. 42, when, after the
defeat of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, the Roman
world passed rnto the hands of the triumvirs Octavian,
Antony, and Lepidus. They had promised their vic-
torious veterans the lands of eighteen tities in Italy,
among which was Cremona, and subsequently it became
necessary to include the neighbouring district of Man-
tua.1 Virgil's father was threatened with the loss of
his farm,2 but the youthful poet had secured the favour
of· C. Asinius Pollio, governor of Cisalpine Gaul, and
of L. Alfenus Varus, his successor (nc. 41), whose
assistance he involtes in the sixth Eclogue. Pollio,
himself a scholar and poet,³ accepted the dedication of
his earliest Eclogues,4 and secured for him an intro-
duction to Octavian at Rome,⁵ as a result of which he
obtained the restoration of the farm. His gratitude to
the youthful triumvir finds expression in the Eclogue

which he prefixed to the others, and which now stands
at their head,
