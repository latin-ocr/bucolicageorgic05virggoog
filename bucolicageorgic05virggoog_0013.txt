viii VIRGIL

himself is said to have written to him from Spain (nc.
27) encouraging him to publish the poem, which he
was known to have in hand, and which Propertius a
year or two later heralds as ‘something greater than the
Iliad.’1 While he was engaged on its composition in
asc. 23, Marcellus, the nephew and destined heir of κ
Augustus, died, and Virgil introduced into the sixth ι
Book the famous passage (860-887) in which he is
described, and of which the story is toldthat when the
poet recited itin the presence of Octavia, the bereaved
mother faiuted away.² In nc. 20 he visited Greece
and met Augustus, who was returning from Samos, at
Atheus, whence he accompanied him homewards, but
his health, which had been long weak, broke down, aud
he died at Brundisium Sept. 22, nc. 19.
He was buried at Naples on the road whichleads to

, , Puteoli. The inscription said to have been inscribed

  on his tomb refers to the places of his birth death, and
burial, and to the subjecte of his three great works: ·

Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
Parthenope: cecini parcam rura, daces.

Virg'il was largely read iu his own day, and his
works, like those of Horace, at once becamea standard
text-book in schools,⁸ and were commented on by
numerous critics and grammarians, of whom Aulus

Gellius in the second century and Macrobius aud
