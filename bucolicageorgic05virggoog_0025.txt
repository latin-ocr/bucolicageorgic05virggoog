and John Milton are to be compared. As we pass with
him into the under world, hythe sole force of genius

he makes a dream seem to us a living fact3 he com· ¹

mands our thoughts to follow whithersoever he leads
them, and they obey ; under his guidance we tread
with ghostly but unhesitating footsteps that dim and
unknown highway which extends beyond the grave.

For an ordinary man, however, to criticise Virgil is y

almost an impertinence. It needs a poet to appreciata

a poet, and the judgment of Alfred Tennyson outweighs ¹

, that of a host of critice and commentators. There ,

could be no more just and happy tribute from one η
. master to another than the following Ode addressed

hy the English to the R'oman Virgil.1 ι
