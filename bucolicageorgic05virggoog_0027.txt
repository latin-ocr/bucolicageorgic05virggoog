VIRGIL

Light among the vanieh’d age03
star that gildeet yet this phantom ehore3

Golden branch amid the thedom,
kinge lmd realme that paee to riee no 'mores

vm

Now thy Forum roare no longer,
fallen every purple Caeear’e dome-

Tho’ thine ocean-roll of rhythm
eound for ever of Imperial Rome·-

lx

Now the Rome of slaves leth perleh'd,

and the Rome of freemen holds her place,
I, from out the Northern leland

eunder'd once from all the human rate,

Iealute thee, Mantovanp,

1 that loved thee eince my day began⁹
Wlelder of the etateliest measure
ever moulded by the lipe of man.
