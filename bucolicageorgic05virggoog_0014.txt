Servius in the fourth are the most important. The
early Christiana in the belief, still unquestioned in the '⁸
days of Pope,l that, the fourth Eclogue contained a
prophecy of Christ, looked upon him almost with
reverence, and it is not merely as the greatest of Italian
singem, but also as something of a saint, that Dante

Sappho, Propertius Callimachus, and so on. Virgil in
his Eclogues professedly imitatos Theocritus, in his
Georgics Hesiod, and in the Aeneid Homer. The
